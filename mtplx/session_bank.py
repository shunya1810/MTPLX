    THE BUG, measured 2026-09-01 (PR #391 receipts/ttft/control.json).
    A three-scenario TTFT screen on Qwen3.8 Flash-Next: a 19,022-token cold
    turn, the same conversation with the model's own reply appended (0.217 s
    visible TTFT, exact restore), and the same turn with the prior assistant
    message re-rendered -- which took **15.79 s, cached=0, cold, on all three
    repeats**. A 70x cliff on exactly the traffic shape the near-prefix lane
    exists for.

    The chain, from the receipt:

    * The bank auto-sized to its 1 GiB FLOOR ("session-bank budget: 1.0G total
      (auto: machine memory plan...), model weights 107.1G" -- the same
      resolution production gets on this box).
    * A 19K-token entry's base snapshot is ~711 MB. Its GDN boundary records
      cost ~87-101 MB EACH, and MTPLX_GDN_BOUNDARY_MAX is 8, so the boundary
      payload alone is ~700-810 MB.
    * ``put`` counts that payload into ``entry_nbytes`` and then refuses the
      ENTIRE entry: eviction_log shows ``skipped_oversized_snapshot`` at
      nbytes=1,398,321,776 and 1,520,850,304 against a 1,073,741,824 budget --
      while the same turn's boundary-LESS commit (710,255,120) was admitted.
    * So the bank only ever held boundary-less entries. The one survivor in the
      receipt reports ``gdn_boundaries: []``.
    * ``recurrent_boundary_at_or_below()`` returns None on such an entry, so
      ``_restore_near_prefix_prompt_state`` rejects every candidate
      (``boundary_not_better:0``), the request falls through to ``restore()``,
      the SSD lookup misses, and the response reports ``ssd_prefix_miss`` --
      which MASKS the real RAM-lane reason and is why this read as an SSD
      problem rather than an admission one.

    Boundary records are the *sheddable* part of an entry: they are pure
    acceleration, reconstructible by re-prefill, and an entry with FEWER
    boundaries still serves every restore an entry with none can. Dropping the
    entry to protect the budget therefore trades a 0.5 s restore for a 15.8 s
    cold prefill in order to save bytes it could have saved by keeping three
    fewer records.

    With shedding, the prompt-boundary entry is admitted with as many records
    as fit; ``put``'s existing ``prefix_donor`` inheritance then carries those
    records onto the generation-final commit, ``_supersede_contained_prefixes``
    collapses the pair (a boundary-carrying container legitimately dominates
    its contained prefixes), and the single entry the 1 GiB budget allows is a
    boundary-carrying one.

    Note the corollary: under this bug, raising MTPLX_GDN_BOUNDARY_MAX from 8 --
    the audit's "cheapest lever" -- makes things WORSE, because it enlarges the
    payload that triggers the refusal.

    keeps one admission policy for its whole life and an A/B arm cannot drift

        the live session's own prefix chain to absorb it trades a
        seconds-long spike for a 50+ second re-prefill on the very next turn
        (2026-08-28 receipt: a 93k OpenCode session's bank was walked to 0
        bytes mid-request, TTFT 54-57 s after). Real macOS pressure keeps
        take-anything semantics — active sessions merely sort last there.

        ``protect_keys`` (entries a prompt is about to restore from, whatever
        session owns them) and ``protect_session_ids`` (sessions generating
        or being released) are never taken: the admission's LRU step used to
        pin only the incoming session, and evicted another idle session's
        entry that was this prompt's restore source (the review of
        9c96dd9c).

        Every caller shrinks to give memory back (the pressure loop's trims,
        the dynamic ceiling, the allocation-failure shed, the admission), so
        each evicted entry's own queued settle and SSD encode are cancelled
        with it (``_evict_entry``); ``cancel_queued_persistence=False`` keeps
        them.

        queued SSD write, with that write (the admission's same-conversation
        entries, ``same_conversation_entries``).

        Bytes are the entries' ``held_nbytes``: what the bank believes it

        short: a deep session's sibling snapshots — forked generations of
        the same conversation whose retokenized histories diverge, so

        with zero evictions and the request 507'd.

        Phase 1 walks non-terminal entries (any session keeps its highest
        ``prefix_len`` entry — the one the protected-terminal order guards).
        Phase 2, only if the deficit stands, takes remaining entries in the
        take-anything order of real memory pressure (active sessions last).
        Both phases spare the entries the imminent prompt may restore from
        (``protect_tokens``, validated by ``restore_source_keys``: the exact
        prefix and the best block-restorable entry; an entry that shares one
        token with the prompt is not a restore source), and
        every eviction is RAM-only: the SSD cold tier still restores a walked
        entry, so the worst case is a disk read on some session's next turn,
        not this request's abort. ``protect_keys`` adds the caller's own
        restore plan (validated with the request's identity) and
        ``protect_session_ids`` spares every session that is generating or
        being released: the walk took their snapshots too.
