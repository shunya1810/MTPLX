"""Nothing goes slow in silence: the process-wide demotion ledger.

Every place the engine leaves the lane it was built to run (a compiled
verifier that runs eager, a sparse prefill that rebuilds the dense mask, a
tensor-unit route that bails on an older GPU) records a count and one plain
line saying why. ``/health`` (``degradation.demotions``), the request log
(``demotions`` on each generation record) and ``mtplx doctor --explain``
read this ledger, so a slow request can be explained from the product,
without a debug switch and without reading source.

Cost contract: ``note`` is a dictionary increment and one reference store.
No device read, no sync, no string formatting (callers on a per-round path
pass a constant reason), no lock (the model owner thread is the only
writer on the decode path, and an int increment under the GIL cannot
corrupt the dictionary). Importing this module imports nothing else from
``mtplx`` and never imports MLX.
