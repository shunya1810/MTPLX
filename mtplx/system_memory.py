"""What the rest of the Mac has left: memory the kernel can hand out without compressing.

The allocator guard measures the engine against its own Metal limit. That limit
is sized from total RAM when the daemon starts, so it says nothing about the
other apps on the desktop. A long cold prefill adds 10 to 15 GiB on top of the
resident weights. When an editor and two browsers already hold the rest, macOS
compresses and swaps the desktop until the UI stops answering, and nothing in
the engine notices: the engine itself is still under its limit.

Receipt (2026-09-19): a 129,050-token Pi compaction prompt, fresh daemon, 128 GB
Mac with a game editor open. The Mac froze about a minute into the prefill and
needed a hard power-off. The same prefill on a quiet desktop wires about 100 GB.

The supply figure is read from ``host_statistics64(HOST_VM_INFO64)``: free pages
(the kernel's free count already includes speculative pages), purgeable pages,
and the file-backed pages that are not speculative. Speculative pages are
counted in both the free and the file-backed counters, so they are taken
once. File-backed pages are credited in full: the kernel reclaims clean file
pages without compressing anything, and ``vm_statistics64`` has no counter for
the dirty ones, which must be written back first (the unified buffer cache
flushes them within about 30 s, and the pages MTPLX itself maps, weights and
the n-gram table, are read-only and clean). The floors below are the margin
for that dirty or busy share, and the death signature catches a Mac whose
file cache is large while its reclaim stalls anyway.
``kern.memorystatus_level`` is kept only as a coarse, reported signal: on macOS
it is ``(total - wired - compressor) / total`` (this Mac, 2026-09-27: level 96
with 3.85 GiB wired and 0.02 GiB compressed; the 2026-09-26 field report: 28
percent at 88 GiB wired + 3.7 GiB compressed, 17 percent at 92.2 + 14.7), so it
counts every app's anonymous memory as available. In that report it read 17
percent while free pages sat at 0.1 to 0.5 GiB and the compressor grew 10 GiB
in 30 s; the Macs that froze had the same shape.

The floor the Mac needs scales with what is wired: wired pages cannot be
compressed or paged, so the more the GPU holds, the less room the kernel has to
absorb a burst. A 128 GB Mac with 83 GiB wired did not recover from 3 GiB free
(the field report's freezes), and its last recorded state before freeze 3 had
5.7 GiB free two seconds before the machine stopped.

Everything here degrades to "unknown" and never to a refusal: a guard that
cannot read the machine takes no action.
