"""Where a request's time to first token goes, span by span.

One clock per request starts when the HTTP request reaches the server: an ASGI
middleware stamps the arrival before routing, the body read, the JSON parse and
the pydantic validation, which the handler's own clock never saw. The request
path then takes named marks (policy resolved, prompt encoded, session resolved,
the previous turn's postcommit waited for, the owner thread started the work,
the model lock taken, the memory admission passed, the first token produced,
the first delta written to the stream). A span is the time between one mark
and the mark before it, named by the later mark. The spans of a request
therefore add up to its time to first token by construction: a slow step can
only show up inside a named span, never between two instruments. The client's
TTFT minus the span sum is only what happens before the server sees the
request and after it writes the first delta (the socket and the client).

Durations that are not on the sequential path are reported beside the spans as
details: where the owner-thread queue wait came from (the item that was running
when this request was submitted), what the engine spent inside its span (the
restore, the SSD read, the prefill forwards, the first sample), and any attempt
a repair or retry path discarded before the one the client received.

Marks live in a small registry keyed by the request id, because the path
crosses the event loop, ``asyncio.to_thread`` workers and the model owner
thread, and the observability dict it could otherwise ride is copied and
serialized along the way.
