"""Machine-aware memory planning: commitments vs caches.

The one place that answers "what fits on this Mac". Issue #305 (2026-08)
showed the cost of not having it: five subsystems (Metal caps, session-bank
budget, per-session snapshot cap, dense-decode ceiling, context window)
each budgeted independently, nothing summed them, and a 48 GB Mac serving
the flagship walked itself to 61.8 GB resident ("129%"), deep swap, and
3-4 tok/s — while a 128 GB Mac with the identical config was fine.

The model:

* **Commitments** cannot be reclaimed without killing a request: model
  weights, and KV for the tokens a session has actually accumulated
  (worst case: the full context window).
* **Caches** are reclaimable in milliseconds: the session-bank RAM tier
  and the MLX allocator pool. They are allowed to take *all* the memory
  commitments don't currently need — precisely because the pressure
  guard (server-side) can seize it back the moment live KV grows.

So the plan is deliberately aggressive-with-a-net, not conservative:
zero throttling and a full-size warm cache while memory is free, and a
dynamic bank ceiling that yields (to the SSD tier, not to oblivion) as a
long-context request's KV actually materializes. Speed on every RAM
tier, no swap-death on any.

Pure arithmetic only. No MLX import, no subprocess, no mtplx imports —
``engine_session`` and the server both import this module, and the
numbers must be computable in tests without a model or a GPU.
