"""One copy of the conversation's attention state (Flash-Next).

On 2026-09-29 a 138K-token Pi session held the same conversation two or three
times: the session bank's snapshot views, the live cache the next request
wrote into (a view blocks MLX's in-place write, so the first write copied the
whole buffer), and the fixed-M4 verifier's padded bank (promotion
concatenated the history into new arrays). The duplicates switched the
compiled decode route off from 98K tokens and caused both mid-answer 507s.

The one-copy store keeps a single set of buffers per conversation:

- the prefill sizes the QSA buffers once to the rows the verifier's bank will
  have (``qwen4_exp.qsa_rows_target``), so the bank adopts them instead of
  copying (``graphbank.TensorOffsetQSACache.adoptable_rows``);
- buffers a turn left at other rows (the prompt fits them and the bank's
  reserve does not, or a turn on the eager verifier grew them its own way)
  are resized to the bank's rows one layer at a time before the bank adopts
  them (``resize_qsa_buffers``);
- the bank hands the same buffers back at the end of the request
  (``demote(keep_capacity=True)``);
- the session bank keeps the conversation as a reference lease with its
  recurrent anchors and never as views of the live buffers.

Numerics do not change: every reader still reads the rows it read before,
at the widths it read them.
