"""Stop, then send again: the conversation keeps its session (2.11.4).

Receipt, founder's native app chat on Flash-Next, 2026-09-20, request log
rows by structure:

1. Turn 1: prompt 90 tokens, 49,879 generated, session ``9040A954``.
2. Turn 2 (a follow-up): ``committed_reasoning_canonicalization`` =
   ``{applied, cp_raw: 90, committed_len: 49968, turns_substituted: 1,
   cp_canon: 49968}``, prompt 50,045 tokens, same session. Stop pressed after
   858 streamed tokens (``cancellation_reason: client_disconnected``).
3. Turn 3 (the follow-up sent again; five messages, because the app keeps
   the interrupted answer as a turn): prompt 26,294 tokens, NO
   canonicalization record, ``ssd_prefix_miss``, 24.5 s to the first token,
   and ``x-mtplx-session-id: 29FE770B``: a different session.

The server did nothing wrong with the cancelled turn. ``EngineSession.commit``
refuses a cancelled finish and the stream's teardown sets ``commit = False``,
so the session stayed at turn 1's committed stream, findable under the
conversation's id. The app asked under a NEW id: it replaced the conversation's
session id with a fresh UUID after every Stop. ``sessions.peek(new_id)`` is
``None``, which is the canonicalizer's silent "first turn" exit, so turn 1's
reasoning was not put back, the prompt no longer extended anything the bank
held, and the whole history was prefilled again.

The fix has two halves. The app keeps the conversation's session id across a
Stop (Swift, ``ChatViewModel.cancelTurn``; its test is
``StopKeepsSessionTests``). That makes a second thing reachable: the follow-up
can now arrive while the cancelled generation still holds the session (the
engine notices a cancel at its next decode round or prefill chunk boundary),
and a named session that is busy used to be refused with "already in flight".
A holder that has already been cancelled is now waited for instead.

Everything here runs on the fake streaming session state: no model, CPU only.
