"""Recurrent checkpoint retention keeps explicit anchors instead of re-thinning.

History, in order:

* 2026-07-17, Hermes lane (MEASUREMENTS 01:05 §B): the pop(1) policy ("keep
  the oldest plus a dense tail") ate the middle, and a ~22.5k near-miss
  restored at the OLDEST boundary, 2,048: a 20k+ re-prefill.
* Its replacement kept one record per power-of-two distance from the NEWEST
  record and re-thinned after every capture. 2026-09-29, Pi (B-cache 2.6):
  thinning again each time the newest record moved eroded the middle anyway,
  and a 16,371-token match restored at 4,096. B-cache reproduced it with the
  real function: a restore at 4,096 followed by a 42.8K prefill kept
  [4096, 34816, 38912, 40960, 43008, 45056, 46873, 46937].

``mtplx.checkpoint_anchors`` now keeps the prompt-end anchor, the restore
point, the stable edge and the newest checkpoint first, then the first
checkpoint of every 8,192-token cell (coarser cells first when the budget
cannot hold them all), then the newest of the rest. These tests drive the
real capture, inheritance and prefill-plan functions:

* the 16,371 case restores at the best anchor at or below 16,371, 8,192, not
  4,096 (fails on the old code);
* an agent session's churn does not erode deep coverage (fails on the old
  code);
* the 2026-07-17 near-tail case stays tight;
* coverage of a uniform grid stays proportional to the divergence;
* an inherited set keeps its restore point.

The old ``test_random_churn_stays_proportional`` pinned a property of the
retired policy on context-free lists: every divergence within ~4K of the
newest record re-prefills at most the divergence plus a slack, which a
cluster of records at the newest one provided. With the same eight records,
explicit anchors put that budget on the grid instead (the 16,371 case needs
it); near the prompt end they keep the prompt-end anchor, the restore point
(the previous prompt's end) and the newest checkpoint, which is where agent
turns diverge (B-cache 5).
